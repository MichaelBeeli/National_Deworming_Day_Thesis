# National Deworming Day Thesis

Code, figures, and tables for my Senior Thesis in Economics: "Worm Eradication: Evaluating a Staggered National Program"

Note: Data is from the ASER Centre, and is not licensed for public use â€” site visitors will not be able to replicate the results.

Scripts are coded in Stata & R.

The code in this repository should allow anyone (with data access) to nearly replicate each of the tables and figures present in the paper. 

The Main Stata Do-File should be run first, followed by the R Scripts. All outputs will be placed in the "Figures" and "Tables" folders within the replication package.
