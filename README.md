Code, figures, and tables for my Senior Thesis in Economics: "How can National Programs and Robust State Capacity Neutralize Infectious Health Risks? Quasi-experimental Evidence from India’s National Deworming Day"

Note: Data is from the ASER Centre, and is not licensed for public use — site visitors will not be able to replicate the results.

Scripts are coded in STATA & Rstudio.

The code in this repository should allow anyone to nearly replicate each of the tables and figures present in the paper. 

The Main STATA Do-File should be run first, followed by the R Scripts. All outputs will be placed in the "Figures" and "Tables" folders within the replication package.
